Simulation Controls
Overview
The Simulation Controls allow users to manage time progression and object movement in the Cesium project. This feature simulates:

Day/Night Cycle – Shows how time progresses, affecting shadow movement based on the sun's trajectory.

Object Motion – Simulates the movement of objects like cars, airplanes, and satellites during the simulation.

Real-Time Sensor Interaction – Allows users to see how added objects and sensors interact dynamically.

Control Functions
Start Simulation – Begins the simulation, enabling time progression and object movement.

Stop Button – Pauses the simulation, freezing all moving objects.

Reset Button – Restarts the simulation from the beginning.

Clear Button – Removes all objects and sensors, allowing users to start a new simulation.
