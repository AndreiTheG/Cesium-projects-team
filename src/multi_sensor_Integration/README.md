Multi-Sensor Integration
Overview
Users can add multiple sensor signals to the simulation. Each sensor can be customized individually without affecting others.

Customizable Sensor Properties:
Field Range – Adjust the sensor’s detection area.

Field of View (FOV) – Modify the sensor’s viewing angle.

Color Customization – Change the sensor’s display color independently.

Sensors can also overlap and combine data to enhance visualization and provide more comprehensive coverage.

Combining Sensor Data
Some developers have implemented functionality that allows multiple sensors to merge their data, creating a combined visualization. This is achieved by blending sensor outputs using a chosen color, making it easier to interpret overall coverage.

Signal Overlapping
The overlapping functionality illustrates how two different signals interact when they coincide.

Visualization:
Blended Colors – When two signals overlap, their colors blend to represent interference.

Separation Effect – When signals move apart, they restore their original colors.

This feature helps visualize constructive and destructive interference, aiding in signal analysis.
