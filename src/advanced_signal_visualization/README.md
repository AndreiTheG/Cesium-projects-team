Advanced Signal Visualization
This folder contains animations developed for signal sensors, including pulse animation and signal overlapping.

Pulse Animation
The pulse animation demonstrates how the amplitude of a signal varies over time, typically in a periodic or transient manner. This visualization is widely used in signal processing, communications, and electronics to represent pulse behavior in both time and frequency domains.

Signal Overlapping
The overlapping functionality illustrates the interaction of two different signals when they coincide. This can be visualized by blending their colors when they overlap and restoring their original colors when separated. This technique helps in understanding constructive and destructive interference in signals.
