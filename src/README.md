# **Cesium Project – Source Code (src/)**

# **Overview**
The src/ folder contains the core functionalities of the Cesium project, each implemented by different team members. These functionalities include:
- Drag and Drop Entities – Allows users to move objects dynamically.
- Rotation Controls – Enables smooth rotation of entities within the environment.
- Modeling Sensor Integration – Supports the integration of various sensor models.
- Advanced Signal Visualization – Provides enhanced graphical representation of signals.
- Pulse Signal – Implements pulse-based signal processing.
- Overlap Indicators – Detects and highlights overlapping entities.
- IoT Interaction – Manages IoT device communication within the simulation.
- Simulation Controls – Offers controls for running and managing simulations.

# **Next Steps**
To improve maintainability and consistency, the following steps should be taken:
- Review Existing Code – Identify common components and redundant implementations.
- Plan Modular Integration – Define a strategy for merging different implementations into a cohesive, modularized application.
- Standardize Code Structure – Establish consistent coding practices to streamline future development.
