Upload Object Configuration
Our team has implemented functionality that allows users to upload .glb objects directly from their computer into the Cesium project. Once uploaded, these objects will appear in the list of available entities, making it easy to add them to the scene dynamically.

This enhancement provides greater flexibility for users to visualize and interact with custom 3D models within the Cesium environment.
