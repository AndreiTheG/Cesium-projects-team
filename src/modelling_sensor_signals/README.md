Modelling Sensor Integration
Overview
The Modelling Sensor Integration module focuses on the implementation of signal modeling within the Cesium environment. This feature enables users to add, visualize, and modify sensor signals dynamically on the 3D globe, enhancing simulation accuracy and flexibility.

Key Functionalities
Users can customize the signal model in several ways:

Adjusting the Field Range → Modify the signal's effective range to control how far it extends.

Changing the Field of View → Set the angular spread of the signal for precise coverage.

Customizing Signal Color → Change the signal’s color to represent different statuses, intensities, or types.

Implementation Details
Utilizes Cesium’s visualization tools to render sensor signals.

Dynamically updates signal attributes using real-time user input.

Ensures smooth interaction with other features such as multi-sensor integration.

Future Enhancements
Real-time signal strength visualization based on terrain and obstacles.

Time-based signal variation for dynamic environmental effects.

Integration with IoT devices for live sensor data streaming.
