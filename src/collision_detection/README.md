# Collision Detection

# Overview
The Collision Detection module enables real-time interaction between signals and entity models within the Cesium environment. When an entity enters the signal’s range, its color dynamically changes to indicate its proximity to the signal’s center. Additionally, a message is displayed to notify the user that the entity is inside the signal’s range.

When the entity moves away from the signal, the system restores the entity's original color and displays a message confirming its departure.

# Key Features
- Proximity-Based Color Change: The entity changes colors progressively as it gets closer to the signal's center.
- Range-Based Notifications: Displays messages indicating when an entity enters or exits the signal’s range.
- Real-Time Updates: The system dynamically adjusts colors and messages as entities move.
