Drag and Drop Functionality
Overview
The Drag and Drop feature allows users to move objects dynamically across the Earth's surface in the Cesium environment. This feature enhances interactivity by enabling users to reposition objects with a simple click-and-drag motion.

Functionality
Objects can be dragged and dropped to any location on the globe.

The movement is controlled via mouse events (click, hold, and release).

Supports real-time updates for smooth object repositioning.

Ensures accurate placement while maintaining terrain and projection constraints.

Can be extended for custom interactions with other modules in the project.

Implementation Details
Listens for mouse events (mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup).

Computes the geographical position of the dragged object in real time.

Uses Cesium's API to update the object's coordinates dynamically.

Optimized for performance to handle multiple objects efficiently.

Future Enhancements
Snap-to-grid functionality for structured placement.

Physics-based dragging with acceleration and inertia effects.

Integration with collision detection to prevent overlapping.
