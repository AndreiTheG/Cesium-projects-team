# **Object Files (obj_files/)**

# **Overview**
The obj_files/ folder contains Cesium-compatible 3D object files provided by individual team members. These files can be used within Cesium applications for visualization and interaction.

# **How to Use These Files?**
- Navigate to a team memberâ€™s folder to access their 3D object files (e.g., .obj, .glb, .gltf).
- Download the required files and upload them to Cesium Ion or host them externally for use in Cesium applications.
- Load the models dynamically into your Cesium project to visualize and manipulate them.

This structure ensures that all 3D assets are well-organized and easily accessible for development and testing.
