How to Use These Files?
Application Videos:
Navigate to the application_videos/ folder to watch each team memberâ€™s project demonstration.

These videos provide insights into how Cesium features are implemented. Each video highlights specific functionalities of the projects, such as collision detection, sensor integration, and 3D visualizations.

3D Object Files:
Explore the obj_files/ folder for Cesium-compatible 3D models in .obj, .glb, and .gltf formats.

Download and upload the files to Cesium Ion or serve them externally for use in Cesium applications.

Import the models dynamically into your Cesium project to visualize and manipulate them.

Demos
The demos/ folder contains recorded demonstrations and 3D object files showcasing key functionalities implemented in the Cesium Team Project. These videos help users understand different features developed by the team.

# 3D Object Files (ðŸ“‚ obj_files/)
This section contains reusable Cesium-compatible 3D models contributed by the team. These models can be loaded into Cesium applications for visualization.

ðŸ“Œ Models include sensor devices, radar systems, and interactive objects.

ðŸ“Œ Available in .obj, .glb, and .gltf formats.

ðŸ“Œ Can be imported into Cesium Ion or used directly in the project.

ðŸ“Œ To explore and download the models, go to:
ðŸ“‚ obj_files/

# Contribution Guidelines
- Each team member should upload their presentation videos inside their respective folder under application_videos/.
- 3D object files should be placed inside the respective subfolder under obj_files/.
- Use descriptive file names for clarity (e.g., sensor_model.glb, radar_visualization.mp4).
- This structure ensures clarity, easy access to both project demonstrations and 3D assets, and seamless integration with Cesium.

# Summary of New Functionalities:
- Drag-and-Drop 3D Models: Allows users to quickly place models into the environment through drag-and-drop.
