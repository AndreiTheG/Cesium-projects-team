# 3D Object Files (ðŸ“‚ obj_files/)
This section contains reusable Cesium-compatible 3D models contributed by the team. These models can be loaded into Cesium applications for visualization.

ðŸ“Œ Models include sensor devices, radar systems, and interactive objects.

ðŸ“Œ Available in .obj, .glb, and .gltf formats.

ðŸ“Œ Can be imported into Cesium Ion or used directly in the project.

ðŸ“Œ To explore and download the models, go to:
ðŸ“‚ obj_files/

# Contribution Guidelines
- Each team member should upload their presentation videos inside their respective folder under application_videos/.
- 3D object files should be placed inside the respective subfolder under obj_files/.
- Use descriptive file names for clarity (e.g., sensor_model.glb, radar_visualization.mp4).
- This structure ensures clarity, easy access to both project demonstrations and 3D assets, and seamless integration with Cesium.

# Summary of New Functionalities:
- Drag-and-Drop 3D Models: Allows users to quickly place models into the environment through drag-and-drop.
- Sensor Parameter Adjustments: Users can modify the behavior of sensors interactively.
- Rotation Controls: Offers rotation control via interface elements or keywords.
- Auto-Movement: Objects in the scene can move automatically based on rules or triggers.
- Sound Controls: Integrates audio for model entities to enhance the environment.
- Auto-Rotation: Models can rotate automatically for continuous dynamic visualization.
- Uploading Object Files: Users can upload new models into Cesium to expand the object library.
- Adding and Launching Objects Based on Coordinates: Objects can be dynamically added and launched at specific coordinate values within the Cesium environment.
